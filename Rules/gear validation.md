Specification: Pathfinder 1e Gear & Economy ValidationPurpose: This document defines the "Business Logic" for validating creature equipment. It describes how to calculate the value of complex items and how to audit a creature's total wealth against the rules.1. The Three Economic TiersPathfinder creatures follow different rules for wealth depending on their role. The validator must first determine which Economy Tier the creature belongs to.Tier A: Heroic NPCsWho: Creatures with levels in PC classes (Fighter, Wizard, Rogue, etc.) that equal or exceed their Racial Hit Dice.Rule Source: Core Rulebook (Table: Character Wealth by Level).Expectation: These creatures have the highest gear value.Logic: Look up the creature's Effective Level in the WealthByLevel table (Heroic Column).Tier B: Basic NPCsWho: Creatures with levels in NPC classes (Warrior, Expert, Adept, Aristocrat, Commoner).Rule Source: GameMastery Guide (Table: NPC Gear).Expectation: These creatures have significantly less gear than heroes.Logic: Look up the creature's Effective Level in the WealthByLevel table (Basic Column).Tier C: MonstersWho: Creatures defined primarily by Racial Hit Dice (Dragons, Trolls, Oozes) with few or no class levels.Rule Source: Bestiary (Treasure Line).Expectation: Wealth is random or based on hoarding behavior.Logic:Standard: Value ≈ Average Treasure for CR.Double/Triple: Multiply the Standard value.Incidental: Half the Standard value.None: Value should be 0.2. The Pricing AlgorithmsThe validator cannot rely on a static database for every item because items can be modified (e.g., "+1 flaming longsword"). It must use a Price Calculation Engine.Algorithm A: Magic Weapons & ArmorFormula: Base Cost + Masterwork Cost + Special Material Cost + Enchantment CostBase Cost: Look up the item name (e.g., "Longsword" = 15 gp).Masterwork Cost:Weapons: +300 gp.Armor/Shields: +150 gp.Note: Magical items are automatically Masterwork; do not double count.Special Material Cost:Adamantine: +3,000 gp (weapon), +5,000 gp (light armor), +10,000 gp (medium armor), +15,000 gp (heavy armor).Mithral: +1,000 gp (light armor), +4,000 gp (medium armor), +9,000 gp (heavy armor), +500 gp/lb (other items).Note: Determine weight category (Light/Med/Heavy) from the base item stats.Enchantment Cost:Sum the numerical bonuses (+1, +2) and the equivalent bonuses of special abilities (e.g., "Flaming" = +1).Weapons: TotalBonus² × 2,000 gp.Armor/Shields: TotalBonus² × 1,000 gp.Constraint: A generic +1 bonus must exist before special abilities can be added.Algorithm B: Wands & PotionsFormula: Spell Level × Caster Level × Base ConstantPotions: Constant = 50 gp.Wands: Constant = 15 gp per charge (750 gp fully charged).Validation Rule: If charges are not listed, assume 50.3. Slot Validation RulesThe system must ensure physically impossible gear configurations are flagged.The "Slot" System:A humanoid creature has exactly one of each of the following slots:Head (Helm)Headband (Phylactery)Eyes (Goggles/Lenses)Shoulders (Cloak)Neck (Amulet/Necklace)Chest (Vest)Body (Robes)ArmorShieldBeltWrists (Bracers)Hands (Gloves/Gauntlets)Ring (Left)Ring (Right)Feet (Boots)Validation Logic:Map every parsed item to a specific Slot.Count the items assigned to each Slot.Error Condition: If count > 1 for any slot (except Rings, which allow 2), flag a "Slot Conflict" error.4. Required Data StructuresTo implement this logic, the code environment will need the following reference data (likely as CSVs):pf1e_base_items.csvColumns: Name, Category (Weapon, Armor, Wondrous), BasePrice, Slot, Weight, ArmorType (Light/Med/Heavy).pf1e_magic_abilities.csvColumns: Name (e.g., Flaming, Fortification), Type (Weapon/Armor), BonusEquivalent (e.g., +1, +2), FlatPrice (if applicable).pf1e_wealth_by_level.csvColumns: Level, Basic_NPC_Wealth, Heroic_NPC_Wealth, PC_Wealth.

Based on the provided *Pathfinder RPG Bestiary*, here is a guide to building and modifying monsters correctly. The primary rules for monster creation are found in Appendix 1, with rules for advancing and modifying monsters in Appendix 2\.

### 🏗️ How to Build a New Monster (Appendix 1\)

\[cite\_start\]Creating a new monster involves a 10-step process that balances its statistics with its desired Challenge Rating (CR)\[cite: 4079\].

**Step 1: Concept** First, define your monster's concept. \[cite\_start\]This includes its desired CR, creature type (like aberration, humanoid, or outsider), physical appearance, and general combat style\[cite: 4079\].

**Step 2: Target Statistics** Use **Table 1–1: Monster Statistics by CR** (page 292\) to determine the approximate target values for your monster's CR. These are guidelines, not strict rules. \[cite\_start\]A monster might be strong in one area (like damage) but weaker in another (like AC) to maintain balance\[cite: 4079, 4080\].

\[cite\_start\]Key target statistics include\[cite: 4079, 4080\]:

* **Hit Points**  
* **Armor Class (AC)**  
* **Attack Bonus** (Use "High Attack" for combat-focused monsters, "Low Attack" for monsters that rely on spells or abilities)  
* **Average Damage** (per round, if all attacks hit)  
* **Ability DC** (The save DC for primary or secondary special abilities)  
* **Saving Throws** (Good and Poor save bonuses)

**Step 3: Hit Dice (HD)** Use **Table 1–2: Creature Hit Dice** (page 292\) to find the average number of Hit Dice for a creature of your chosen type and CR. \[cite\_start\]HD determines many other statistics, such as feats, skills, HP, and save DCs\[cite: 4079, 4080\].

**Step 4: Size** Choose a size for the monster. \[cite\_start\]Size sets the baseline for its physical ability scores (Strength, Dexterity, Constitution) and its natural weapon damage\[cite: 4079\]. \[cite\_start\]You can reference **Table 1–3: Size** (page 293\) for base ability scores\[cite: 4083\].

**Step 5: Ability Scores** Assign the monster's ability scores.

* \[cite\_start\]**Physical Scores (Str, Dex, Con):** These should be relatively close to the base values listed in **Table 1–3: Size**\[cite: 4083\].  
* **Mental Scores (Int, Wis, Cha):** These are defined by your concept. \[cite\_start\]The baseline is 10\. Creatures with an Intelligence of 2 or lower are generally mindless or incapable of speech\[cite: 4083\].

**Step 6: Skills and Feats**

* **Skills:** Use **Table 1–4: Creature Statistics by Type** (page 293\) to find the number of skill ranks your monster gets per Hit Die. \[cite\_start\]Assign these ranks based on its concept and its type's class skills\[cite: 4083, 4081\].  
* \[cite\_start\]**Feats:** A creature with an Intelligence score gets feats based on its total Hit Dice: 1 feat for 1 HD, and one additional feat for every 2 HD after the first (3 HD, 5 HD, etc.)\[cite: 4083\]. \[cite\_start\]Refer to **Table 1–6: Statistics Summary** (page 293\) for a quick chart\[cite: 4081\].

**Step 7: Other Statistics** Calculate the monster's derived statistics:

* \[cite\_start\]**AC:** Add its Dexterity modifier, natural armor bonus, and any armor/shield bonuses to get close to the target AC from Step 2\[cite: 4083\].  
* \[cite\_start\]**Attack Bonuses:** Calculate its Base Attack Bonus (BAB) using **Table 1–4** (by type) or **Table 1–6** (by HD)\[cite: 4081, 4083\]. Add Strength (for melee) or Dexterity (for ranged) and other modifiers to get the final bonus.  
* \[cite\_start\]**Damage:** Use **Table 1–5: Average Die Results** (page 293\) and **Table 3–1: Natural Attacks by Size** (page 302\) to determine damage dice to meet the average damage for its CR\[cite: 4081, 4083, 4087\].  
* \[cite\_start\]**Saves:** Calculate saves based on HD, type (**Table 1–4**), and ability scores\[cite: 4081, 4083\].  
* **Speed:** Most Medium creatures have a 30 ft. speed. Adjust this based on size (Large and quadrupeds are often faster, Small are often slower). \[cite\_start\]Climb and burrow speeds are usually half the base speed, while fly speeds are often double\[cite: 4083\].

**Step 8: Special Abilities and Qualities** \[cite\_start\]Assign special abilities based on your concept, using the Universal Monster Rules (Appendix 3, page 297\) whenever possible\[cite: 4083, 2674\].

**Ability Save DCs:** The save DC for a special ability is typically: \[cite\_start\]**10 \+ 1/2 the monster’s HD \+ the monster’s relevant ability modifier** (usually Constitution or Charisma)\[cite: 4083\].

**Step 9: Treasure** \[cite\_start\]Assign treasure based on the monster's CR, using **Table 1–7: XP and GP Values by CR** (page 294)\[cite: 4083, 4082\]. \[cite\_start\]Remember to account for any gear the monster is using\[cite: 4083\].

**Step 10: Details** \[cite\_start\]Finally, fill in the flavorful details, such as its name, alignment, environment, and ecology\[cite: 4083\].

### ⬆️ How to Advance a Monster (Appendix 2\)

\[cite\_start\]Appendix 2 provides several ways to modify existing monsters to make them more or less powerful\[cite: 4082, 2674\].

#### *1\. Simple Templates*

\[cite\_start\]These are sets of rules you can apply to a monster with minimal effort\[cite: 4082\]. \[cite\_start\]They provide "quick rules" for on-the-fly adjustments and "rebuild rules" for detailed changes\[cite: 4082\].

* **Advanced Creature (CR \+1):** Makes the creature fiercer.  
  * **Quick Rules:** \+2 on all rolls (including damage) and special ability DCs; \+4 to AC and CMD; \[cite\_start\]+2 hp/HD\[cite: 4082\].  
  * **Rebuild Rules:** Natural armor \+2; \[cite\_start\]+4 to all ability scores (except Int scores of 2 or less)\[cite: 4082\].  
* **Celestial Creature (CR \+0 or \+1):** A good-aligned outsider. CR increases by \+1 if the base creature has 5+ HD. \[cite\_start\]Gains darkvision, energy resistances, DR/evil, Spell Resistance (SR), and **Smite Evil** 1/day\[cite: 4082\].  
* **Fiendish Creature (CR \+0 or \+1):** An evil-aligned outsider. CR increases by \+1 if the base creature has 5+ HD. \[cite\_start\]Gains darkvision, energy resistances, DR/good, SR, and **Smite Good** 1/day\[cite: 4082\].  
* **Giant Creature (CR \+1):** A larger, stronger version.  
  * **Rebuild Rules:** Size increases one category; natural armor \+3; attack damage dice increase one step; \[cite\_start\]+4 size bonus to Str and Con, –2 Dex\[cite: 4082\].  
* **Young Creature (CR –1):** An immature specimen.  
  * **Rebuild Rules:** Size decreases one category; natural armor –2; attack damage dice decrease one step; \[cite\_start\]–4 Str, –4 Con, \+4 size bonus to Dex\[cite: 4082\].

#### *2\. Adding Racial Hit Dice*

\[cite\_start\]This process makes a monster a more powerful version of itself\[cite: 4082\].

1. \[cite\_start\]**Plan:** Determine the new target CR and if the monster's size should increase (generally recommended if HD increases by 50% or more)\[cite: 4082\].  
2. **Add HD:** Use **Table 2–1: Monster Advancement** (page 295\) to find the target HP change. \[cite\_start\]Add Hit Dice (using the monster's type) to reach this new HP total\[cite: 4082\].  
3. **Ability Scores:** Add \+1 to one ability score for every 4 new HD. \[cite\_start\]Also apply ability score changes from **Table 2–2: Size Changes** (page 296\) if its size increased\[cite: 4083\].  
4. **Skills and Feats:** Add new skill ranks based on the monster's type and new HD. \[cite\_start\]Add new feats (1 for every 2 HD added)\[cite: 4083\].  
5. \[cite\_start\]**Statistics:** Recalculate all derived stats (AC, saves, attack bonuses, CMB/CMD, etc.) based on the new HD, ability scores, feats, and size\[cite: 4083\]. \[cite\_start\]Use **Table 2–3: Size Bonuses and Penalties** (page 296\) for size-based adjustments\[cite: 4083\].  
6. \[cite\_start\]**Compare:** Check the new stats against **Table 1–1** (page 292\) to ensure it matches the target CR\[cite: 4083, 4080\].

#### *3\. Adding Class Levels*

\[cite\_start\]This is the most complex advancement method\[cite: 4084\].

1. \[cite\_start\]**Determine Role:** Identify the monster's role: **Combat** (melee/ranged), **Spell** (casts spells), **Skill** (stealth/ambush), or **Special** (relies on unique abilities)\[cite: 4084\]. (Appendix 13, page 323, lists monster roles) \[cite\_start\]\[cite: 4101\].  
2. **Add Class Levels:**  
   * **Ability Scores:** Creatures with PC class levels get \+4, \+4, \+2, \+2, \+0, and –2 adjustments assigned to enhance their class abilities. (NPC classes get no adjustments) \[cite\_start\]\[cite: 4084\].  
   * **Add Levels:** Add all class features, HD, BAB, saves, skills, and feats from the new class levels. \[cite\_start\]Abilities like spellcasting or sneak attack stack if the monster already possessed them\[cite: 4084\].  
   * \[cite\_start\]**Treasure:** A monster with class levels gets treasure equal to a heroic NPC of a level equal to the monster's final CR\[cite: 4084\].  
3. **Determine CR:**  
   * **Key Classes:** As a guideline, **Table 2–4: Monsters with Class Levels** (page 297\) shows which classes are "key" for each monster role. \[cite\_start\]A level in a key class generally adds \+1 to the monster's CR\[cite: 4084\].  
   * **Other Classes:** A level in a non-key class adds \+1 CR for every 2 class levels added, until the number of new levels equals the monster's original CR. \[cite\_start\]After that, every level adds \+1 CR\[cite: 4084\].

Based on the Pathfinder 1st Edition books you've uploaded (like the *Core Rulebook*, *Bestiary*, and *GameMastery Guide*), here is a guide to understanding and assigning "proper" Hit Dice (HD) for creatures and NPCs.

### A Guide to Hit Dice (HD) for Creatures and NPCs

In Pathfinder 1st Edition, "Hit Dice" is the foundation of a creature's or character's statistics. A Hit Die represents a "level" of experience or innate power. It determines a creature's Hit Points (HP), Base Attack Bonus (BAB), base saving throw bonuses, skill ranks, and the total number of feats it possesses.

Understanding "proper" HD means knowing which *type* of Hit Dice to use. There are three primary ways HD is determined in Pathfinder.

---

### 1\. Player Characters (PC) & "Heroic" NPCs

This is the most straightforward method, detailed in the *Core Rulebook*, *Advanced Player's Guide*, and *Advanced Class Guide*.

4. **How HD is Determined:** By **Class Level**.  
5. **Die Type:** Depends on the specific class.  
   * **d6:** "Fragile" classes (e.g., Sorcerer, Wizard).  
   * **d8:** "Versatile" classes (e.g., Bard, Cleric, Druid, Rogue).  
   * **d10:** "Martial" classes (e.g., Fighter, Paladin, Ranger).  
   * **d12:** The "Toughest" class (Barbarian).  
6. **What it Governs:**  
   * **HP:** At 1st level, PCs and "Heroic" NPCs get the maximum die roll. Every level after, they roll (or take the average) and add their Constitution modifier.  
   * **BAB & Saves:** Determined by the class's progression (fast, medium, or slow).  
   * **Skill Ranks:** Determined by the class \+ Intelligence modifier.  
   * **Feats:** 1 feat at 1st level, and another at every odd-numbered level (3rd, 5th, etc.).

**When to use this:**

7. For all Player Characters (PCs).  
8. For major villains, rivals, or important allies who are built with the same rules as PCs.

---

### 2\. Monsters (Racial Hit Dice \- RHD)

This method is the focus of the *Bestiary*. Most monsters do not have class levels. Their power comes from their innate nature.

9. **How HD is Determined:** By **Racial Hit Dice (RHD)**.  
10. **Die Type:** Depends on the creature's **Type**. This is a critical rule, found in the *Bestiary* appendices.  
    * **d6:** Fey, Outsider (native)  
    * **d8:** Aberration, Animal, Dragon, Giant, Humanoid, Magical Beast, Ooze, Plant, Undead, Vermin  
    * **d10:** Construct, Outsider (non-native)  
11. **What it Governs:**  
    * **HP:** Roll all RHD and add the creature's Con modifier for *each* die. (Monsters do not get max HP at 1st level unless their first HD is from a PC class).  
    * **BAB & Saves:** Determined by the RHD and the chassis of the creature's Type (e.g., Humanoids have "medium" BAB and good Reflex saves; Undead have "medium" BAB and good Will saves).  
    * **Skill Ranks:** Determined by the RHD and the creature's Type \+ Int modifier.  
    * **Feats:** 1 feat for the first RHD, and another for every 2 RHD after that (3 HD, 5 HD, 7 HD, etc.).

**When to use this:**

12. For all standard monsters found in the *Bestiary* (e.g., Goblins, Dragons, Golems, Zombies).  
13. When "Advancing" a monster (as rules in the *Bestiary*): You can add more RHD to a base monster to make it a tougher "leader" or "alpha" version.

---

### 3\. "Simple" NPCs (NPC Classes)

This method is detailed in the *GameMastery Guide*. It's used for the vast majority of unnamed characters in the world who aren't adventurers.

14. **How HD is Determined:** By **NPC Class Level**.  
15. **Die Type:** Depends on the specific NPC class.  
    * **d6:** Commoner, Expert  
    * **d8:** Adept, Aristocrat  
    * **d10:** Warrior  
16. **What it Governs:**  
    * **HP:** Roll (or take average) for each level and add Con modifier.  
    * **BAB & Saves:** All NPC classes have a "slow" BAB progression and a specific "good" save (e.g., Warrior has good Fortitude, Expert has good Reflex).  
    * **Skill Ranks:** Determined by the class.  
    * **Feats:** 1 feat at 1st level, and another at every odd-numbered level.

**When to use this:**

17. For creating guards, shopkeepers, cultists, nobles, or any other "background" character.  
18. These classes are intentionally weaker than PC classes to make them easy to run and keep the focus on the heroes.

---

### The Most Important Rule: Combining HD

This is the advanced step, combining **Path 1** and **Path 2**.

A creature's **Total Hit Dice** is the *sum* of its **Racial Hit Dice** and its **Class Levels**.

19. **Total HD \= RHD \+ Class Levels**

This "Total HD" is what you use to determine its total feats, skill rank caps, and ability score increases (one point every 4 HD).

**Example: A Bugbear Fighter**

1. **Base Monster (Path 2):** A standard Bugbear (from the *Bestiary*) is a 3 HD Humanoid.

   * **RHD:** 3d8  
   * **BAB/Saves:** From 3 levels of "Humanoid" (medium BAB, good Reflex).  
   * **Feats:** 2 (1 at 1st HD, 1 at 3rd HD).  
2. **Add Class Levels (Path 1):** You decide to make this Bugbear a **Level 2 Fighter**.

   * **Class Levels:** 2d10 (from Fighter)  
   * **BAB/Saves:** You add 2 levels of "Fighter" progression (fast BAB, good Fort).  
3. **The Result: The "Bugbear Fighter 2"**

   * **Total HD:** 5 (3 RHD \+ 2 Class Levels)  
   * **HP:** (3d8 \+ 2d10) \+ (5 x Con modifier)  
   * **BAB:** Add the BAB from 3 Humanoid RHD \+ 2 Fighter levels.  
   * **Saves:** Add the base saves from both sources (3 Humanoid \+ 2 Fighter).  
   * **Total Feats:** 3 (1 at 1st HD, 1 at 3rd HD, 1 at 5th HD). It also gets its Fighter bonus feats.  
   * **Total Skill Ranks:** Sum the ranks from its 3 RHD (Humanoid) and 2 Fighter levels.

This method is how you create the vast majority of unique, challenging "boss" monsters and specialized creatures in your game.

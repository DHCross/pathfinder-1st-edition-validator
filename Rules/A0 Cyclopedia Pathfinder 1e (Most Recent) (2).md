SPECIAL ABILITIES

**Hypnotic Glance (Su)**  When a creature Elemara can see targets her with an attack, she can force that creature to make a DC 15 Will save to avoid becoming charmed until the start of its next turn, causing the creature to choose a new target or lose their attack.  
**Magical Disguise (Su)** Elemara appears as a human woman at all times unless she chooses to reveal her true form. Elemara’s Magical Disguise is not discernable through magical effects such as *Detect Magic* or *True Seeing* unless the casters succeed a DC 16 Knowledge (Arcana) check. Elemara may drop or resume her disguise as a Swift Action.  
**Petrifying Gaze (Su)** While Elemara is in her true form, any creature that starts its turn within 30 ft. of her and can see her eyes must succeed on a DC 15 Fortitude save to avoid being turned to stone. On a failure, the creature is paralyzed. The creature must repeat the save at the end of its next turn. On a success, the effect ends. On a failure, the creature is petrified until freed by magical means. Creatures can avert their eyes as a free action to automatically succeed this save, though doing so causes the creature to become Blinded against Elemara.   
**Serpent Hair (Ex)** While Elemara is in her true form and a creature starts their turn within 5 ft. of her, she may make a **Serpent Hair Strike** against that creature as an immediate action. Additionally, Elemara can make a **Serpent Hair Strike** as a Swift Action.

# New Rules

## Acid Rain

Any creature that begins its turn in an area of acid rain must make a Fortitude save (DC 12\) or take 1d4 acid damage from the rain. Any armor or clothing that fully covers the creature will protect from the rain, but acid rain also has corrosive properties that can affect items. Every minute that an item is exposed to rain, roll a d12:

* Non-magical metal weapons, armor, and objects are destroyed on a 4 or lower.  
* Uncommon items are destroyed on a 3 or lower.  
* Rare items are destroyed on a 1\.  
* Very Rare and Legendary items are unaffected.

Some flora and fauna grow resistant to acid rain. If any resistant plants are used to shield a creature from the rain, no tests are necessary, the shield survives. 

## “The Bite”

A cruel affliction festering in the poorest gutters and alleys of the city, *the bite* is named not for how it’s caught, but for how it feels. Victims scratch themselves bloody, claiming something “under the skin” is chewing its way free. It spreads easily among the unwashed and malnourished—especially children.

**Contracting the Disease.** Prolonged exposure to unsanitary conditions, close contact with an infected individual, or inhabiting a hovel where the disease is common forces a DC 11 Fortitude save for every night spent resting. Failure results in infection.

Any creature spending more than 1 hour in close quarters (within 10 feet) of an infected individual must succeed on a DC 11 Fortitude save or become infected themselves.

**Symptoms.** Symptoms begin 1d3 days after exposure, typically in the form of red, swollen welts that itch uncontrollably. Over time, these welts split and weep a foul-smelling yellow fluid.

**Effects.** While infected, the creature gains no benefit from natural healing such as resting. The creature receives a \-5 penalty to Stealth and Diplomacy checks due to visible sores and constant itching. At dawn each day, the infected creature must make a DC 11 Fortitude save or become fatigued. If already fatigued, the creature instead becomes exhausted. If already exhausted, the creature becomes energy drained, gaining a negative temporary level that lasts until the creature cures The Bite or dies.

**Recovery.** The disease can be cured by magical means (*remove disease*, etc.) or by succeeding on three consecutive DC 11 Fortitude saves made at the end of a long rest, provided the creature has access to clean water and shelter.

## Sewer Rot

*Disease (contact-based), virulent and persistent*

**Contracting the Disease.** A creature with an open wound (HP below maximum, or who has taken slashing/piercing/bludgeoning damage in the last hour) who comes into direct contact with contaminated sewer water, filth, or refuse must succeed on a DC 13 Fortitude save or contract Sewer Rot.

**Symptoms**. The first symptom of weariness sets in within d12+12 hours

**Effects.** Stage 1 Fatigue (Days 1–2): The infected creature becomes fatigued and cannot recover from the fatigued condition until the disease is cured. At dawn each day, the creature must make a DC 12 Fortitude save. On a failed save, the disease progresses to Stage 2\.

Stage 2: Rot and Necrosis (Days 3–5): The infected creature’s fatigue intensifies, doubling the Strength and Dexterity penalties to \-4. Additionally, hit point maximum is reduced by 1d4-1 each day the disease remains untreated. Each dawn, make another DC 15 Fortitude save. On a failed save, the disease progresses to Stage 2\.

Stage 3: Advanced Sewer Rot (Day 6+): The infected creature’s fatigue is replaced with exhaustion, and cannot recover from the exhausted condition until the disease is cured. Hit point maximum is reduced by 1d6 per day. If the creature’s hit point maximum drops to 0, it dies. It cannot benefit from healing spells of 2nd level or lower unless cured.

**Recovery.** Magical means of disease removal of CL lower than 5 are ineffective against Sewer Rot, halting the disease’s progression for 24 hours, but not curing it. Magical means of CL 5 or greater or a DC 15 heal action are required to cure Sewer Rot, and must be followed by 7 days of care and 2 successful saves from the infected creature to fully cure Sewer Rot. A creature that recovers naturally is immune to Sewer Rot for 1d6 months.

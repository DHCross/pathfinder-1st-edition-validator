# Foundation Builder

This module initializes a new monster or NPC creation, handling base types:
- NPC-Centric (class-based)
- Monster-Centric (base stat block)
- From Scratch (CR target and suggested baselines)

This placeholder contains minimal components and will evolve into a set of UI components and API interfaces used by the app's Foundation Builder.

## Notes

### Validation & Format
- All XP values corrected to match Core Rulebook Experience Point Awards table
- CMD calculations verified and corrected
- HP values adjusted to appropriate benchmarks for CR
- Tab-delimited format compatible with InDesign "Convert Text to Table" (Tab / Paragraph delimiters)

### Narrative Alignment Protocol (Dec 22, 2025)
**Pacing Change:** Shifted from "Ambush Fatigue" to "Travel → Hazard → Travel → Scavenge" rhythm.

**Travel Distance Retcon:** Caravan ambush now occurred ~65 miles from Second Chance (not further), allowing the "Slow Party" (16 miles/day with injured Arlo) to arrive in 4 days.

**Rosie's Cover:** Changed from "Trader" to **"Lady's Maid"** to appear more vulnerable.

### Creatures CUT from Act 1
| Creature | Reason |
|----------|--------|
| Keruc'Tuk | Eliminate early combat fatigue |
| Lizardfolk | Part of cut ambush encounter |
| Hyena | Part of cut ambush encounter |
| Chaos-Mutated Toad | Replaced by "Self-Healing Road" terrain puzzle |
| Demonic Orc Scout | "Demonic Harmonic" encounter cut entirely |
| Stökkjaft (Split-Maw Hare) | Not in revised encounter list |

### Revised Day-by-Day Encounter Flow
- **Day 1:** Acid Aftermath (scavenging) + Self-Healing Road (terrain puzzle) — *No creatures*
- **Day 2:** Mutant Rabbit Warren (hunting/survival)
- **Day 3:** The Watchful Rest — Brintus, Maltorio, Elemara, Vickus (social/optional combat)
- **Day 4:** River Travel — River Swarm attack during hull repairs *(needs statting)*
- **Day 4.5:** Docks (Litorro), Rat's Nest (Rat King), Warehouse Finale (Rosie, Gnomes, Arlo)

### Outstanding Work
- **⚠️ River Swarm:** Needs full stat block creation (swarm-style, many weak attackers)
